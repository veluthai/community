✨ The Problem We're Solving
Let's be real. The current student experience is a chaotic mess of tabs, apps, and missed notifications. 🤯

❌ Announcements on one portal...
❌ Quizzes on another...
❌ Coding practice somewhere else...
❌ Event updates lost in an email chain...
This leads to FOMO, low engagement, and zero sense of a unified learning journey. It's time for a change!
